    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Jollof</strong>, or <strong>jollof rice</strong>, is a rice dish from West Africa. 
        The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilis, onions, spices, 
        \and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, 
        although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions. 
        The dish's origins are traced to Senegal.</p>

    <p>Regional variations are a source of competition among the countries of West Africa, 
        and in particular between Nigeria and Ghana, over whose version is the best; 
        in the 2010s this developed into a friendly rivalry known as the <em>"Jollof Wars"</em>.</p>
