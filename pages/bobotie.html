    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 fairly thick slice crustless bread (white or brown)</li>
        <li>375ml milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>10ml butter</li>
        <li>2 onions, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chutney</li>
        <li>1 tbsp smooth apricot jam</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp tumeric</li>
        <li>2 tbsp brown vinegar</li>
        <li>1kg raw minced beef</li>
        <li>100g sultanas</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and tumeric to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak bread in milk. Heat oil and butter in large pan and fry onions and garlic.</li>
        <li>When onions are soft, add curry powder, salt, chutney, jam, Worcester sauce, turmeric and vinegar and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Drain and mash bread and reserve milk. Add bread to pan together with mince and sultanas.
        </li>
        <li>Cook over low heat, stirring, and when meat loses its pinkness, remove from stove. Add 1 beaten egg, mix well, then spoon into a greased, 28 x 16 cm baking dish and level the top.
        </li>
        <li>Beat remaining eggs with reserved milk (you should have 300ml, or a little more) and the salt and turmeric.
        </li>
        <li>Pour over meat mixture and put a few bay leaves on top. Stand dish in a larger pan of water (this is important to prevent drying out) and bake, uncovered, at 180 degrees celsius for 1 hour or until set.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with rice, coconut, chutney, almonds and bananas.
        </li>
    </ol>
